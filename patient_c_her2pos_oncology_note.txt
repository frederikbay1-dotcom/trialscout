CHIEF COMPLAINT:
================================================================================

62-year-old female with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, progression on 
first-line trastuzumab/pertuzumab/paclitaxel, presents for discussion of second-line 
treatment options.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
================================================================================

Ms. [Patient] is well known to me. She was originally diagnosed with Stage IIA 
HER2-positive breast cancer in March 2019. Initial presentation and treatment course:

**ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS (March 2019):**
- Right breast invasive ductal carcinoma, 2.8 cm, Grade 2
- Biomarkers: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER2 IHC 3+ (HER2-positive)
- Clinical stage: cT2N0M0 (Stage IIA)

**INITIAL TREATMENT (2019):**
- Lumpectomy + sentinel lymph node biopsy (April 2019)
  * Final pathology: pT2N0 (0/3 lymph nodes involved)
  * Margins negative
  * Grade 2/3
  * ER 90%, PR 70%, HER2 3+, Ki-67 35%

- Adjuvant chemotherapy (May-August 2019):
  * Dose-dense AC x4 cycles (doxorubicin 60 mg/m² + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m²)
  * Followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m² weekly x12 weeks
  * Concurrent trastuzumab started with paclitaxel
  * Tolerated well, completed all planned cycles

- Adjuvant radiation therapy (September-October 2019):
  * Whole breast radiation 50 Gy in 25 fractions
  * Boost to tumor bed 10 Gy in 5 fractions
  * Completed without complications

- Adjuvant targeted therapy (2019-2024):
  * Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV Q3 weeks continued for 1 year (through September 2020)
  * Switched to letrozole 2.5 mg daily for endocrine therapy (ER+/HER2+ disease)
  * Continued letrozole through January 2024

**DISEASE RECURRENCE (January 2024):**

Patient presented with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes in 
January 2024. Workup revealed:

- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (January 15, 2024): Multiple hepatic lesions, largest 
  4.2 cm in segment VI. Multiple smaller lesions throughout liver. Bilateral 
  pulmonary nodules. No brain metastases on brain MRI.

- Liver biopsy (January 18, 2024): Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast 
  primary. Biomarkers maintained: ER 85%, PR 65%, HER2 3+, Ki-67 42%

- Restaging: Stage IV breast cancer with liver and lung metastases

**FIRST-LINE METASTATIC TREATMENT (February 2024 - December 2024):**

Started on standard first-line HER2-positive metastatic regimen:
- Trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 6 mg/kg Q3 weeks
- Pertuzumab 840 mg IV loading dose, then 420 mg Q3 weeks  
- Paclitaxel 80 mg/m² IV weekly

Treatment course:
- Initial excellent response: Liver lesions decreased by 60% on CT after 3 months
- Continued partial response through month 9 (October 2024)
- Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy developed (managed with dose reduction and gabapentin)
- Baseline LVEF 60%, remained stable on serial echocardiograms

**DISEASE PROGRESSION (December 2024):**

Restaging CT scan December 18, 2024 showed:
- Progression of liver metastases: New lesions, increase in size of existing lesions
- New pleural effusion (right-sided, moderate)
- Stable pulmonary nodules
- RECIST criteria: Progressive disease after 11 months of therapy

Thoracentesis performed December 23, 2024: Cytology positive for malignant cells 
consistent with breast primary. Removed 800 mL pleural fluid, patient symptomatically 
improved.

Patient discontinued trastuzumab/pertuzumab/paclitaxel after cycle 16 (December 20, 2024) 
due to confirmed progression.

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT:
================================================================================

62-year-old woman with metastatic HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 
now with disease progression after 11 months of first-line trastuzumab/pertuzumab/paclitaxel.

Key features:
1. HER2-POSITIVE maintained on biopsy of metastatic site → Continue HER2-directed therapy
2. PROGRESSION ON TRASTUZUMAB/PERTUZUMAB → Need alternative HER2-targeted agent
3. EXCELLENT CARDIAC FUNCTION (LVEF 58%) → Eligible for T-DXd or other HER2 ADCs
4. NO BRAIN METASTASES → Fortunate (HER2+ has high CNS risk)
5. SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE → Liver metastases, pleural effusion, needs effective therapy

================================================================================
TREATMENT PLAN:
================================================================================

**SECOND-LINE RECOMMENDATION: TRASTUZUMAB DERUXTECAN (T-DXd / ENHERTU)**

Based on DESTINY-Breast03 trial data showing superior PFS and OS compared to T-DM1 in 
second-line HER2+ metastatic breast cancer:
- Median PFS: 28.8 months (T-DXd) vs 6.8 months (T-DM1)
- Median OS: Not reached vs 34.1 months
- ORR: 79.7% vs 34.2%

Regimen: Trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks

**ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS DISCUSSED:**
1. T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) - FDA approved but inferior to T-DXd per DESTINY-Breast03
2. Tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine - Excellent option especially if brain mets develop
3. Neratinib + capecitabine - Considered but T-DXd preferred
4. Clinical trial enrollment - Discussed, patient prefers standard therapy for now

Patient chose T-DXd after thorough discussion of benefits, risks, and alternatives.

**KEY SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS FOR T-DXd:**

1. INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (ILD):
   - Occurs in ~15% patients (most Grade 1-2)
   - Requires baseline pulmonary assessment (done, clear)
   - Monthly monitoring for respiratory symptoms
   - Patient educated: Report any new cough, dyspnea, fever
   - Hold T-DXd if Grade 2+ ILD, permanently discontinue if Grade 3-4

2. CARDIAC MONITORING:
   - LVEF assessment before each cycle initially (baseline 58%, excellent)
   - Risk of decreased LVEF ~4% (lower than traditional trastuzumab)

3. NAUSEA:
   - Common (80% any grade, usually Grade 1-2)
   - Aggressive antiemetic prophylaxis planned

**PLAN:**

1. **START T-DXd: Cycle 1, Day 1 scheduled for February 1, 2025**
   - Trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 mg/kg (8.7 mg/kg x 62 kg = 335 mg actual dose, 
     rounds to 337.5 mg based on vial size 100 mg)
   - Administer IV over 90 minutes (first dose), subsequent doses 30 minutes if tolerated
   - Every 3 weeks (21-day cycle)

2. **PREMEDICATIONS:**
   - Ondansetron 24 mg IV prior to T-DXd
   - Dexamethasone 10 mg IV prior to T-DXd
   - Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (infusion reaction prophylaxis for first dose)
   - Famotidine 20 mg IV

3. **ANTIEMETIC REGIMEN (for home):**
   - Ondansetron 8 mg PO TID days 1-4 after each infusion
   - Olanzapine 5 mg PO QHS days 1-4 (highly effective for delayed nausea)
   - Compazine 10 mg PO Q6H PRN breakthrough nausea
   - Encourage adequate hydration

4. **MONITORING:**
   - CBC with differential before each cycle
   - CMP before each cycle (monitor liver function given hepatic metastases)
   - LVEF assessment by echocardiogram every 3 cycles initially (baseline 58%)
   - Monthly assessment for respiratory symptoms (ILD monitoring)
   - Restaging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 3 (week 9)
   - Baseline pulmonary function tests if any respiratory symptoms develop
   - Continue brain MRI every 6 months (HER2+ CNS risk)

5. **SUPPORTIVE CARE:**
   - Continue gabapentin 300 mg TID for neuropathy (slowly taper as improves)
   - Pleural effusion: Monitor with imaging, thoracentesis PRN if re-accumulates
   - Pain management: Continue oxycodone PRN, escalate if needed
   - Social work involved for copay assistance (T-DXd expensive, ~$14,000/dose)

6. **PATIENT EDUCATION:**
   - Discussed expected side effects: nausea (very common), fatigue, alopecia (mild), 
     decreased blood counts, ILD risk (~15%, mostly low grade)
   - CRITICAL: Report any new cough, shortness of breath, fever → May indicate ILD
   - Report chest pain, palpitations, leg swelling → Cardiac monitoring
   - Avoid NSAIDs initially (can worsen GI side effects)
   - Hair loss typically mild/partial with T-DXd (unlike traditional chemo)

7. **FOLLOW-UP:**
   - Return for Cycle 1, Day 1 on February 1, 2025
   - Labs 1-2 days before each treatment
   - Office visit every 3 weeks during treatment
   - Urgent visit if fever, severe dyspnea, chest pain

**PROGNOSIS:**

With modern HER2-targeted therapies, median OS for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer exceeds 
5 years. DESTINY-Breast03 data suggests T-DXd may provide >2 years PFS in this setting. 
Patient has several additional lines of therapy available if needed (tucatinib-based, 
T-DM1, neratinib, other investigational agents).

Liver metastases and pleural effusion indicate more aggressive disease biology, but HER2 
positivity remains highly favorable prognostic factor given multiple effective targeted options.

Patient understands diagnosis, treatment plan, and expected outcomes. All questions addressed. 
She is motivated to proceed with T-DXd and understands importance of ILD monitoring.

================================================================================
IMPRESSION AND PLAN SUMMARY:
================================================================================

62F with HER2+/ER+ metastatic breast cancer, progression on first-line 
trastuzumab/pertuzumab/paclitaxel after 11 months.

**PLAN:** Start trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) 5.4 mg/kg IV Q3 weeks

**Prior treatments documented:**
- Surgery: Lumpectomy (2019)
- Radiation: Whole breast radiation (2019)
- Chemotherapy: AC → paclitaxel adjuvant (2019), paclitaxel metastatic (2024)
- Targeted therapy: Trastuzumab adjuvant (2019-2020), trastuzumab + pertuzumab metastatic (2024)
- Endocrine therapy: Letrozole (2020-2024)

**Current status:** ECOG 1, adequate organ function, LVEF 58%, no brain metastases, 
ready to start second-line therapy with T-DXd.

Close monitoring for ILD, cardiac function, and treatment response. Restaging after 
cycle 3.

Patient educated and in agreement with plan.
