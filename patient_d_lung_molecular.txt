ACTIONABLE MUTATIONS DETECTED:
================================================================================

EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) - TIER 1 ACTIONABLE
  Gene: EGFR (chr 7:55174776)
  Variant: Exon 19 deletion
  Specific Mutation: p.Glu746_Ala750del (c.2236_2250del15)
  Alternative Nomenclature: E746_A750del, del E746-A750
  Variant Allele Frequency (VAF): 38.4%
  Variant Classification: PATHOGENIC
  Functional Impact: ACTIVATING MUTATION
  
  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  This is a well-characterized activating mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.
  Associated with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
  
  FDA-APPROVED TARGETED THERAPIES:
  - First-line: Osimertinib (Tagrisso), Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Afatinib (Gilotrif)
  - Osimertinib is preferred first-line agent per NCCN guidelines
  
  PROGNOSIS: EGFR exon 19 deletions are associated with longer progression-free survival 
  on EGFR TKI therapy compared to wild-type EGFR (median PFS 12-18 months).

================================================================================
RESISTANCE MUTATIONS: NONE DETECTED
================================================================================
EGFR T790M: NOT DETECTED (associated with acquired TKI resistance)
EGFR C797S: NOT DETECTED (associated with osimertinib resistance)

Note: These resistance mutations are typically acquired after TKI treatment and are 
not expected in treatment-naive patients.

================================================================================
ADDITIONAL GENOMIC ALTERATIONS TESTED:

  Mutation: NOT DETECTED

KEAP1:
  Mutation: NOT DETECTED

================================================================================
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
================================================================================

PD-L1 Expression (22C3 pharmDx assay):
  Tumor Proportion Score (TPS): 5%
  Interpretation: LOW EXPRESSION
  
  Clinical Significance:
  - TPS <1%: PD-L1 negative
  - TPS 1-49%: PD-L1 low/intermediate (5% = LOW)
  - TPS ≥50%: PD-L1 high
  
  Therapy Implications:
  - Pembrolizumab monotherapy FDA approved for TPS ≥1% (patient qualifies)
  - However, EGFR+ patients typically treated with EGFR TKI first-line per guidelines
  - Checkpoint inhibitors may be considered after TKI progression

ALK Immunohistochemistry (D5F3 clone):
  Result: NEGATIVE (score 0)
  No cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells

HISTOLOGIC MARKERS:
  TTF-1 (Thyroid Transcription Factor-1): POSITIVE (diffuse nuclear)
  Napsin A: POSITIVE (diffuse cytoplasmic)
  CK7: POSITIVE
  CK20: NEGATIVE
  p40: NEGATIVE
  
  Interpretation: Profile consistent with lung adenocarcinoma primary

================================================================================
TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN (TMB):
================================================================================
Result: 3.8 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb)
Interpretation: TMB-LOW

Clinical Note: TMB-low tumors typically have limited benefit from immunotherapy.
EGFR-mutant tumors characteristically have low TMB.

Reference Range:
  - TMB-Low: <10 mut/Mb
  - TMB-Intermediate: 10-20 mut/Mb
  - TMB-High: >20 mut/Mb (associated with checkpoint inhibitor response)

================================================================================
MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY (MSI):
================================================================================
Result: Microsatellite Stable (MSS)
No evidence of mismatch repair deficiency

================================================================================
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
================================================================================

HISTOLOGIC SUBTYPE: Adenocarcinoma, acinar and papillary pattern
TUMOR GRADE: Moderately differentiated (Grade 2)
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified in this small biopsy sample
NECROSIS: <5%

TUMOR STAGING (based on clinical information):
  cT3N2M1c - Stage IVB
  - Primary tumor: Right upper lobe (4.2 cm by CT)
  - Lymph nodes: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy (N2)
  - Distant metastases: Brain (multiple lesions), bone (T10 vertebra)

================================================================================
CLINICAL INTERPRETATION & RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

SUMMARY:
This lung adenocarcinoma harbors an EGFR exon 19 deletion, a well-established oncogenic 
driver mutation that predicts sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. FIRST-LINE THERAPY:
   - Osimertinib (Tagrisso) 80 mg daily is the preferred first-line agent
   - Alternative TKIs: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib (if osimertinib not available)
   - Expected response rate: 70-80%
   - Median PFS: 15-18 months

2. AVOID CONCURRENT IMMUNOTHERAPY:
   - EGFR TKI + checkpoint inhibitor combinations show increased toxicity without benefit
   - Reserve immunotherapy for post-TKI progression (if no T790M)

3. BRAIN METASTASES MANAGEMENT:
   - Osimertinib has excellent CNS penetration
   - Consider concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) depending on lesion size/number
   - Monitor CNS response closely with brain MRI

4. MONITORING:
   - Repeat imaging every 6-8 weeks initially
   - At progression: Repeat biopsy or liquid biopsy to assess for T790M or other resistance mechanisms
   - ~60% of patients develop T790M resistance mutation → treatable with continued osimertinib

5. CLINICAL TRIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Patient may be eligible for trials combining EGFR TKI with novel agents
   - Consider fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors at progression

PROGNOSIS:
EGFR-mutant NSCLC with exon 19 deletion has favorable prognosis with targeted therapy.
Median overall survival with modern TKI therapy: 30-40 months.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- No concurrent resistance mutations detected (T790M negative - expected in treatment-naive patient)
- Low PD-L1 expression and TMB-low status suggest limited benefit from immunotherapy
- TP53 co-mutation detected but not currently actionable
- Mutually exclusive pattern with KRAS (as expected)
