================================================================================
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
================================================================================

DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+), HER2-low breast cancer, 
           with progression after 12 months of first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor + aromatase inhibitor

DISEASE STATUS: Progressive disease (PD) by RECIST criteria

ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS: 1

SUMMARY:
Ms. [REDACTED] is a 61-year-old woman with metastatic ER+/PR+/HER2-low breast cancer who 
has progressed after 12 months of excellent disease control on first-line letrozole + palbociclib. 
Repeat biopsy confirms maintained hormone receptor and HER2-low status. She remains highly 
functional with ECOG PS 1 and is an excellent candidate for second-line therapy.

TREATMENT OPTIONS DISCUSSED:

1. CHEMOTHERAPY (Standard of Care):
   - Single-agent options: paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin
   - Combination options: gemcitabine/carboplatin
   - Pros: Established efficacy, covered by insurance
   - Cons: More toxicity, hair loss, neuropathy risk, IV administration

2. ENDOCRINE-BASED THERAPY:
   - Fulvestrant 500 mg IM + capivasertib (AKT inhibitor) - if PIK3CA mutant
   - Fulvestrant + alpelisib - if PIK3CA mutant
   - Elacestrant (oral SERD) - if ESR1 mutant
   - Note: Would need additional genomic testing (ctDNA or tissue NGS)

3. ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES (ADC):
   - Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy) - FDA approved for HR+/HER2- after 2+ prior lines
     * Currently 1 prior line (may not meet criteria yet)
   - Trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) - Emerging data for HER2-low breast cancer
     * DESTINY-Breast04 showed benefit in HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/FISH-)
     * Patient has HER2 IHC 1+ → qualifies as HER2-low
     * FDA approved August 2022 for HER2-low after 1-2 prior lines of chemo

4. CLINICAL TRIALS:
   - Discussed clinical trial options given HER2-low status
   - Patient interested in trials evaluating novel HER2-low targeted therapies
   - Will refer to clinical trial nurse coordinator for enrollment screening

PLAN:
1. Obtain liquid biopsy (Guardant360 CDx) to assess for actionable mutations:
   - PIK3CA, AKT1, ESR1 mutations
   - Other potential targetable alterations
   - Expected turnaround: 10-14 days

2. Refer to clinical trial coordinator for HER2-low breast cancer trials:
   - DESTINY-Breast06 (T-DXd vs chemotherapy in HER2-low)
   - TROPiCS-02 (sacituzumab govitecan vs chemotherapy in HR+/HER2-)
   - Additional trials as available

3. If not eligible for clinical trials or patient preference for standard therapy:
   - Plan for trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 mg/kg IV q3weeks
   - Pre-medications: dexamethasone, antiemetics
   - Baseline pulmonary function tests (ILD screening)
   - Baseline MUGA or echocardiogram (LVEF must be ≥50%)

4. Hold letrozole and palbociclib (already discontinued)

5. Supportive care:
   - Continue denosumab for bone health
   - Monitor for symptoms, especially dyspnea (ILD risk with T-DXd)

6. Follow-up:
   - Return in 2 weeks to review liquid biopsy results
   - Discuss clinical trial options vs standard therapy
   - Begin treatment within 3-4 weeks

PATIENT COUNSELING:
Lengthy discussion with patient and husband regarding disease progression, treatment options, 
clinical trials, and prognosis. Patient expresses strong interest in clinical trial participation, 
particularly trials targeting HER2-low disease. She understands the risks and benefits of 
chemotherapy vs targeted therapy. She will think about her options and discuss with family.

Patient is aware that HER2-low is a newer classification with emerging treatment options. 
She understands trastuzumab deruxtecan has shown benefit in clinical trials but has risks 
including interstitial lung disease (ILD). She will report any new cough or shortness of breath.

Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with plan.

TIME: 45 minutes (>50% spent in counseling and coordination of care)
