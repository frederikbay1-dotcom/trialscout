  "HER2-low": "Your cancer cells have small amounts of a protein called HER2. This is different from HER2-positive (high amounts) or HER2-negative (none detected). Newer drugs like Enhertu are designed specifically for HER2-low cancers. Your pathology report will show this as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ with negative FISH/ISH test.",
  
  "ER+": "Estrogen receptor positive means your cancer cells have receptors that respond to the hormone estrogen. This is important because it means hormone-blocking therapies may help treat your cancer.",
  
  "PR+": "Progesterone receptor positive means your cancer cells have receptors that respond to the hormone progesterone. Like ER+, this suggests hormone therapies may be effective.",
  
  "CDK4/6 inhibitor": "A type of pill (like palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib) that slows cancer cell growth by blocking proteins called CDK4 and CDK6. These are often used as first-line treatment for ER+ breast cancer.",
  
  "ECOG performance status": "A scale from 0-4 that doctors use to measure how cancer affects your daily activities. 0 = fully active, 1 = some restrictions, 2 = able to care for yourself but can't work. Most trials require 0-1.",
  
  "LVEF": "Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction - a measurement of how well your heart pumps blood. Normal is 50% or higher. Some cancer drugs can affect the heart, so trials check this for safety.",
  
  "Metastatic": "Cancer that has spread from where it started to other parts of the body. Also called Stage IV or advanced cancer.",
  
  "Neoadjuvant": "Treatment given before surgery to shrink a tumor. This is for patients with early-stage cancer who are planning surgery.",
  
  "Triple-negative": "Breast cancer that doesn't have estrogen receptors (ER-), progesterone receptors (PR-), or HER2 protein. This subtype requires different treatments than hormone-positive cancers.",
  
  "IHC": "Immunohistochemistry - a lab test that looks for specific proteins in cancer cells. For HER2, the scores are 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+.",
  
  "ISH/FISH": "In situ hybridization / Fluorescence in situ hybridization - tests that look at genes in cancer cells. Used to confirm HER2 status when IHC is 2+.",
  
  "Stage IV": "Cancer that has spread to other organs or distant parts of the body. Also called metastatic or advanced cancer.",
  
  "Stage II-III": "Cancer that is larger or has spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant organs. Often treated with surgery.",
