"My last scan showed the cancer is growing again despite taking the Tagrisso."

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
================================================================================

Mr. [REDACTED] is a 58-year-old male with metastatic EGFR-mutant (exon 19 deletion) 
lung adenocarcinoma who presents for follow-up after recent imaging showing disease progression 
on first-line osimertinib therapy.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY SUMMARY:

November 2024: INITIAL DIAGNOSIS
- Presented with persistent cough, hemoptysis, and headaches
- CT chest: 4.2 cm right upper lobe mass, mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- Brain MRI: Multiple brain metastases (largest 1.8 cm left parietal)
- Bone scan: T10 vertebral metastasis
- Staging: cT3N2M1c, Stage IVB

- CT-guided biopsy of lung mass (11/28/2024)
  Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma, lung primary
  
- Molecular testing (MSK-IMPACT, reported 12/5/2024):
  * EGFR: Exon 19 deletion (p.E746_A750del) - POSITIVE
  * VAF: 38.4%
  * ALK: Negative
  * ROS1: Negative
  * KRAS: Negative
  * PD-L1 TPS: 5% (low expression)
  * TMB: 3.8 mut/Mb (TMB-low)

December 2024: INITIAL TREATMENT
- Started osimertinib (Tagrisso) 80 mg daily on 12/15/2024
- Brain: Received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to three largest lesions (12/20/2024)
  * Target lesions: left parietal (1.8 cm), right frontal (1.2 cm), left cerebellar (0.9 cm)
  * Dose: 20 Gy x 1 fraction per lesion
  * Tolerated well, completed as planned
- Started dexamethasone 2 mg BID for peritumoral edema (tapered off by 1/10/2025)

TREATMENT RESPONSE (First 6 weeks):
- Excellent initial clinical response
- Symptom improvement: cough resolved, no further hemoptysis, headaches improved
- Restaging CT chest (1/20/2025 - 5 weeks post-treatment):
  * Primary tumor: 4.2 cm → 2.8 cm (34% reduction)
  * Mediastinal nodes: Significantly decreased
  * No new lesions
  * RECIST: Partial Response (PR)
  
- Brain MRI (1/22/2025 - 5 weeks post-SRS/osimertinib):
  * Treated lesions: Good local control, decreased edema
  * Concerning finding: THREE NEW small enhancing lesions (5mm, 7mm, 4mm) in right temporal lobe
  * Suggests intracranial progression despite systemic response

CURRENT PRESENTATION (January 2025):
Patient returns today with recent imaging showing:

1. INTRACRANIAL PROGRESSION:
   - Three new brain metastases detected on 1/22/2025 MRI
   - All small (<1 cm) but concerning for early CNS progression
   - Patient reports mild new headaches over past 2 weeks (controlled with acetaminophen)
   - No focal neurologic deficits
   - Previously treated lesions show good control post-SRS

2. SYSTEMIC DISEASE STATUS:
   - Recent CT chest (1/20/2025) showed excellent response (PR)
   - Primary tumor shrinking, nodes decreasing
   - No new extracranial disease

INTERPRETATION:
Isolated CNS progression on osimertinib after only 6 weeks of treatment, while systemic 
disease shows good response. This pattern suggests either:
  a) Inadequate CNS penetration despite osimertinib (unusual, as osimertinib has excellent BBB penetration)
  b) CNS-specific resistance mechanisms
  c) Very aggressive CNS disease biology

Patient has been on osimertinib for only 6 weeks total. Early CNS progression is concerning.

CURRENT SYMPTOMS:
- Mild intermittent headaches (1-2x/week, responsive to acetaminophen)
- No seizures, no focal weakness, no visual changes, no nausea/vomiting
- Respiratory symptoms: Resolved (no cough, no dyspnea, no hemoptysis)
- Fatigue: Mild (grade 1), improved from baseline
- Appetite: Good
- Weight: Stable

ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS: 1 (ambulatory, capable of light work)

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
================================================================================

DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic EGFR-mutant (exon 19 deletion) lung adenocarcinoma, Stage IVB,
           with isolated CNS progression on first-line osimertinib

DISEASE STATUS: 
- Systemic: Partial Response (PR) - excellent response
- CNS: Progressive Disease (PD) - three new brain metastases

OVERALL STATUS: Mixed response with concerning early CNS progression

ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS: 1

SUMMARY:
58-year-old male with EGFR exon 19 deletion NSCLC initially presented with Stage IVB disease 
including brain metastases. Started on osimertinib 80 mg daily with concurrent SRS to largest 
three brain lesions. After only 6 weeks of treatment, shows excellent systemic response (PR) 
but has developed three new small brain metastases, indicating isolated CNS progression.

This is an unusual and concerning pattern, as osimertinib typically has excellent CNS penetration 
and activity. Early CNS progression (within 6 weeks) suggests aggressive CNS disease.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR EARLY CNS PROGRESSION:
1. Inadequate CNS drug penetration (unusual for osimertinib)
2. CNS-specific resistance mechanisms (too early for typical T790M)
3. Highly aggressive CNS disease biology
4. Possible subtherapeutic osimertinib levels (rare)

MANAGEMENT OPTIONS DISCUSSED:

1. LOCAL CNS THERAPY:
   Option A: Repeat SRS to three new lesions
     - Pros: Effective local control, minimal toxicity, can continue osimertinib
     - Cons: Doesn't address micrometastatic CNS disease, may see further new lesions
   
   Option B: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
     - Pros: Treats visible and micrometastatic disease
     - Cons: Neurocognitive effects, would prefer to avoid if possible

2. SYSTEMIC THERAPY ADJUSTMENTS:
   Option A: Continue osimertinib (excellent systemic response) + add local CNS therapy
   Option B: Increase osimertinib dose to 160 mg daily (off-label, not FDA approved but some data)
   Option C: Switch to combination therapy or different TKI

3. LIQUID BIOPSY:
   - Check plasma ctDNA for T790M resistance mutation (though very early for this)
   - Assess for other resistance mechanisms

4. CLINICAL TRIAL ENROLLMENT:
   - Consider trials specifically for EGFR+ NSCLC with CNS metastases
   - Trials combining osimertinib with CNS-penetrant agents

TREATMENT PLAN:

1. LOCAL CNS THERAPY - URGENT:
   - Neurosurgery/Radiation Oncology consult scheduled for 1/30/2025
   - Plan for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to three new lesions
   - Will schedule SRS within 1-2 weeks

2. CONTINUE OSIMERTINIB:
   - Continue osimertinib 80 mg daily given excellent systemic response
   - Consider dose escalation to 160 mg daily if further CNS progression after SRS
   - Patient understands off-label nature of dose escalation

3. OBTAIN LIQUID BIOPSY:
   - Guardant360 CDx plasma ctDNA test ordered today
   - Assess for T790M or other resistance mutations
   - Results expected in 7-10 days

4. ENHANCED CNS MONITORING:
   - Brain MRI every 4-6 weeks (more frequent than usual) given early progression
   - Next brain MRI scheduled for 4 weeks post-SRS
   - Patient instructed to report new neurologic symptoms immediately

5. CONTINUE SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS:
   - Continue levetiracetam 500 mg BID
   - Will discuss with neuro-oncology regarding duration

6. SUPPORTIVE CARE:
   - Rash management: Topical clindamycin for grade 1 acneiform rash
   - No dose reduction needed at this time
   - Encourage sunscreen use

7. CLINICAL TRIAL DISCUSSION:
   - Will refer to clinical trial coordinator for EGFR+ trials with CNS focus
   - Patient open to clinical trial participation if appropriate

8. FOLLOW-UP:
   - Return visit in 2 weeks after SRS to assess tolerance
   - Review liquid biopsy results at that visit
   - Repeat brain MRI in 4-6 weeks
   - Repeat chest CT in 8 weeks (continue monitoring systemic response)

PROGNOSIS DISCUSSION:
Lengthy discussion with patient and wife regarding concerning pattern of early CNS progression. 
Explained that while systemic response is excellent, CNS disease requires aggressive management. 
Discussed that some patients develop CNS-specific resistance patterns, and we will need to 
monitor closely. Patient understands the situation and agrees with plan for SRS to new lesions 
while continuing osimertinib for systemic control.

Patient counseled on signs/symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (severe headache, 
vision changes, nausea/vomiting, confusion) and instructed to call immediately or go to ED 
if these develop.

CLINICAL TRIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Patient may be eligible for trials evaluating:
- Osimertinib + investigational CNS-penetrant agents
- Novel EGFR TKIs with enhanced CNS activity
- Combination targeted therapy approaches

Will coordinate with clinical trial team for screening.

PATIENT UNDERSTANDING:
Patient and wife verbalized understanding of diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis.
They understand the urgency of addressing CNS progression while maintaining systemic control.
All questions answered. Patient agrees with plan.

TIME SPENT: 60 minutes (>50% spent counseling regarding disease status and treatment options)
