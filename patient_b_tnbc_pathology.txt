================================================================================
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
================================================================================

LEFT BREAST, CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY:
- Invasive ductal carcinoma, high grade
- See immunohistochemistry results below

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Received in formalin labeled with patient name and "left breast biopsy" are four tan tissue cores, 
each measuring up to 1.8 cm in length and 0.15 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections show breast tissue infiltrated by invasive ductal carcinoma arranged in sheets and irregular 
nests. The tumor cells demonstrate marked nuclear pleomorphism with vesicular chromatin and prominent 
nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are present (32 per 10 HPF). Central necrosis is identified within 
tumor nests. The tumor shows minimal tubule formation. Adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is 
present, high nuclear grade, with comedo necrosis.

================================================================================
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS:
================================================================================

HORMONE RECEPTOR PANEL:

Estrogen Receptor (ER) - Clone SP1:
  RESULT: NEGATIVE
  Tumor cell staining: 0%
  Intensity: None
  H-Score: 0/300
  Allred Score: 0/8
  INTERPRETATION: Complete absence of ER expression
  
  Note: Per ASCO/CAP guidelines (2020), ER is considered positive if ≥1% of tumor cells 
  show nuclear staining. This tumor shows 0% staining and is therefore ER-negative.

Progesterone Receptor (PR) - Clone 1E2:
  RESULT: NEGATIVE
  Tumor cell staining: 0%
  Intensity: None
  H-Score: 0/300
  Allred Score: 0/8
  INTERPRETATION: Complete absence of PR expression

HER2/NEU ASSESSMENT:

HER2 Immunohistochemistry (PATHWAY 4B5):
  RESULT: 0 (HER2-NEGATIVE)
  Interpretation: No staining observed OR incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely 
  perceptible and within ≤10% of tumor cells
  
  Per ASCO/CAP 2023 Guidelines:
  - IHC Score 0 = HER2-NEGATIVE
  - FISH/ISH testing not performed (not indicated for IHC 0)
  
  CLINICAL NOTE: This tumor is classified as HER2-negative. It does not meet criteria for 
  HER2-low (which requires IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-).

TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER CONFIRMATION:
This tumor is ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative, confirming the diagnosis of 
TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (TNBC).

PROLIFERATION MARKER:

Ki-67 Proliferation Index (Clone MIB-1):
  RESULT: 78%
  Interpretation: Very high proliferative activity
  
  Note: Ki-67 >30% indicates high proliferative activity. This tumor shows exceptionally 
  high proliferation at 78%, consistent with aggressive biology.

ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATORY MARKERS:

Cytokeratin 7 (CK7): POSITIVE (diffuse)
GATA3: POSITIVE (focal, supporting breast primary)
Mammaglobin: NEGATIVE
CK5/6: POSITIVE (focal - basal marker, common in TNBC)
EGFR: POSITIVE (focal membrane staining - seen in ~50% of TNBC)

TUMOR GRADE (Modified Bloom-Richardson/Nottingham):
  Tubule formation: Score 3 (minimal tubule formation, <10%)
  Nuclear pleomorphism: Score 3 (marked variation, vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli)
  Mitotic count: Score 3 (32 mitoses per 10 HPF - high)
  TOTAL SCORE: 9/9
  HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 3 (Poorly differentiated)

================================================================================
PD-L1 TESTING:
================================================================================

PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (22C3 pharmDx):
  Combined Positive Score (CPS): 15
  Tumor Proportion Score (TPS): 8%
  
  Interpretation: PD-L1 POSITIVE by CPS ≥10 criteria
  
  Clinical Significance:
  - CPS ≥10 indicates potential benefit from pembrolizumab + chemotherapy per KEYNOTE-355 trial
  - PD-L1 positivity by CPS in TNBC predicts improved outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors
  - Consider pembrolizumab combination therapy for metastatic disease

================================================================================
COMMENT:
================================================================================

This is an invasive ductal carcinoma, high grade (Grade 3), with triple-negative phenotype 
(ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative).

TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER represents approximately 15% of all breast cancers and is defined 
by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 expression. TNBC is associated with:
- Younger age at diagnosis
- Higher histologic grade
- Higher Ki-67 proliferation index
- More aggressive clinical behavior
- Higher risk of visceral metastases
- Higher risk of brain metastases
- Better response to chemotherapy (paradoxically)
- Lack of endocrine therapy options
- Lack of HER2-targeted therapy options

PD-L1 POSITIVITY (CPS 15) in this tumor suggests potential benefit from immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy. Per KEYNOTE-355 study results, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy 
significantly improved outcomes in PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10) TNBC compared to chemotherapy alone.

TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS:
- Chemotherapy is the primary systemic treatment modality
- Consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy if patient desires breast conservation
- Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy should be considered for metastatic disease (CPS ≥10)
- Germline BRCA testing recommended for all TNBC patients
- PARP inhibitor therapy if BRCA mutation identified
- Clinical trial enrollment should be considered given aggressive biology

Ki-67 proliferation index of 78% indicates very high proliferative activity and aggressive 
tumor biology. Combined with Grade 3 histology, this suggests high-risk disease requiring 
aggressive multimodal treatment.

Additional molecular profiling (genomic testing, BRCA testing) recommended to identify 
potential therapeutic targets and assess hereditary risk.

================================================================================
ANCILLARY STUDIES RECOMMENDED:
================================================================================

1. GERMLINE BRCA1/2 TESTING: 
   Recommended for all patients with TNBC, particularly those <60 years old
   Identifies candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy (olaparib, talazoparib)

2. TUMOR GENOMIC PROFILING:
   Consider next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to identify actionable mutations
   May identify PIK3CA, AKT1, or other targetable alterations

3. IMAGING WORKUP:
   Complete staging with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   Consider brain MRI given TNBC's propensity for CNS metastases
