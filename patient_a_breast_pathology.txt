Recent imaging shows disease progression with new hepatic lesions.
Repeat biopsy requested for biomarker confirmation prior to consideration of clinical trial enrollment.

SPECIMEN:
A. Liver, Segment VI, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy

================================================================================
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
================================================================================

LIVER, SEGMENT VI, CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY:
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with breast primary
- See immunohistochemistry results below

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Received in formalin labeled with patient name and "liver biopsy" are three tan-brown tissue cores, 
each measuring up to 1.5 cm in length and 0.1 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections show hepatic parenchyma infiltrated by adenocarcinoma with morphologic features 
consistent with breast origin. The tumor cells are arranged in cords and small glands within 
the hepatic sinusoids. Tumor cells demonstrate moderate nuclear pleomorphism with vesicular 
chromatin and small nucleoli. Mitotic figures are present (approximately 8 per 10 HPF). 
No necrosis is identified.

================================================================================
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS:
================================================================================

HORMONE RECEPTOR PANEL:

Estrogen Receptor (ER) - Clone SP1:
  RESULT: POSITIVE
  Tumor cell staining: 95%
  Intensity: Strong (3+)
  H-Score: 285/300
  Allred Score: 8/8
  INTERPRETATION: Strong ER expression maintained from primary tumor

Progesterone Receptor (PR) - Clone 1E2:
  RESULT: POSITIVE
  Tumor cell staining: 80%
  Intensity: Moderate to Strong (2-3+)
  H-Score: 220/300
  Allred Score: 7/8
  INTERPRETATION: Strong PR expression

HER2/NEU ASSESSMENT:

HER2 Immunohistochemistry (PATHWAY 4B5):
  RESULT: 1+ (HER2-LOW / HER2-NEGATIVE)
  Interpretation: Faint/barely perceptible incomplete membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells
  
  Per ASCO/CAP 2023 Guidelines:
  - IHC Score 1+ = HER2-NEGATIVE for trastuzumab/pertuzumab eligibility
  - IHC Score 1+ = HER2-LOW for novel antibody-drug conjugate eligibility (e.g., T-DXd)
  
  HER2 FISH/ISH: Not performed per current guidelines (FISH not indicated for IHC 0 or 1+)
  
  CLINICAL NOTE: The designation "HER2-low" has therapeutic implications. Clinical trials 
  with trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) have shown efficacy in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.

PROLIFERATION MARKER:

Ki-67 Proliferation Index (Clone MIB-1):
  RESULT: 28%
  Interpretation: Moderate proliferative activity

ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATORY MARKERS:

Cytokeratin 7 (CK7): POSITIVE (diffuse)
GATA3: POSITIVE (diffuse, strong nuclear)
Mammaglobin: POSITIVE (focal)
Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein-15 (GCDFP-15): POSITIVE (focal)
TTF-1: NEGATIVE
CDX2: NEGATIVE
CK20: NEGATIVE

TUMOR GRADE (Modified Bloom-Richardson/Nottingham):
  Tubule formation: Score 2 (moderate, 10-75%)
  Nuclear pleomorphism: Score 2 (moderate variation)
  Mitotic count: Score 2 (8 mitoses per 10 HPF)
  TOTAL SCORE: 6/9
  HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 2 (Moderately differentiated)

================================================================================
COMMENT:
================================================================================

The morphologic features and immunophenotype are consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma 
of ductal type. The tumor retains strong estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, 
confirming hormone receptor-positive status.

HER2 testing shows IHC 1+ staining, which classifies this tumor as "HER2-low" per updated 
ASCO/CAP guidelines (2023). While this result is considered HER2-negative for traditional 
anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), it may predict benefit from newer 
antibody-drug conjugates such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, which have shown efficacy in 
the HER2-low population.

The Ki-67 proliferation index of 28% indicates moderate proliferative activity.

Comparison with prior pathology (2021 primary tumor): Similar ER/PR/HER2 profile maintained, 
confirming endocrine-sensitive disease biology despite clinical progression on CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Clinical correlation and multidisciplinary discussion recommended for treatment planning, 
including consideration of clinical trial enrollment.
