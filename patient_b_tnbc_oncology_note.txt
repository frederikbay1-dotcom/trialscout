CHIEF COMPLAINT:
================================================================================

56-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer 
presents for treatment planning and discussion of systemic therapy options.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
================================================================================

Ms. [Patient] is a 56-year-old woman who presented with a self-detected left breast 
mass in December 2024. Initial workup with diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound revealed 
a 3.2 cm irregular mass in the left breast upper outer quadrant with suspicious axillary 
lymphadenopathy.

Core needle biopsy performed January 10, 2025 confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma, 
Grade 3, with triple-negative phenotype:
- ER: Negative (0%)
- PR: Negative (0%)
- HER2: 0 (HER2-negative, IHC 0)
- Ki-67: 78% (very high proliferative index)
- PD-L1 (22C3): CPS 15 (POSITIVE)

Complete staging workup performed:
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (January 15, 2025): Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules 
  consistent with metastatic disease. Largest nodule 2.8 cm in right upper lobe. 
  Multiple smaller nodules throughout both lungs. Subcarinal lymphadenopathy. 
  No liver, bone, or adrenal metastases identified.

- Brain MRI with contrast (January 17, 2025): No evidence of brain metastases

- PET-CT (January 20, 2025): Hypermetabolic left breast mass (SUV 12.4), 
  hypermetabolic bilateral pulmonary nodules (SUV 4.2-8.7), hypermetabolic mediastinal 
  and left axillary lymph nodes. No other sites of distant disease.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Stage IV triple-negative breast cancer (cT2N1M1, lung metastases)

Patient presents today for discussion of first-line systemic therapy options for 
metastatic TNBC.

================================================================================
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
================================================================================

None. This is patient's first cancer diagnosis.

No prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy.
No prior breast biopsies or breast surgeries.

================================================================================
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
================================================================================

1. Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q8H PRN pain
2. Ondansetron 8 mg PO Q8H PRN nausea (prescribed in anticipation of chemotherapy)
3. Multivitamin daily
4. Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

================================================================================
FAMILY HISTORY:
================================================================================

- Mother: Breast cancer at age 62 (ER+/HER2- per patient, treated with surgery and 
  tamoxifen, alive at 84)
- Maternal aunt: Ovarian cancer at age 58 (deceased at 61)
- Father: Prostate cancer at age 70 (alive at 81)
- Sister (age 58): No cancer history

GENETIC TESTING: Germline BRCA1/2 testing sent January 22, 2025 (results pending)

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
================================================================================

DIAGNOSIS: Stage IV triple-negative breast cancer (cT2N1M1), PD-L1 positive (CPS 15), 
presenting for first-line systemic therapy.

DISCUSSION:

This is a 56-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic triple-negative breast 
cancer with lung metastases. Key features:

1. TRIPLE-NEGATIVE PHENOTYPE: ER-, PR-, HER2- → Not eligible for endocrine therapy 
   or HER2-targeted therapy. Chemotherapy is primary treatment modality.

2. PD-L1 POSITIVE (CPS 15): Meets criteria for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy per 
   KEYNOTE-355 trial. CPS ≥10 predicts benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor.

3. TREATMENT-NAÏVE: No prior systemic therapy. Eligible for first-line regimens.

4. GOOD PERFORMANCE STATUS: ECOG 1, adequate organ function, good candidate for 
   combination therapy.

5. PENDING BRCA RESULTS: If BRCA1/2 mutation identified, PARP inhibitor maintenance 
   may be option after response to chemotherapy.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:

Based on KEYNOTE-355 data showing improved PFS and OS in PD-L1+ TNBC (CPS ≥10), 
I recommend:

**FIRST-LINE THERAPY: PEMBROLIZUMAB + CHEMOTHERAPY**

Regimen: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV + Paclitaxel 90 mg/m² IV weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off)
OR: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV + Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m² IV weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off)

- Pembrolizumab Q3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (up to 2 years)
- Paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for 4-6 cycles, then pembrolizumab maintenance
- Add carboplatin/gemcitabine option discussed as alternative if taxane contraindication

ALTERNATIVE REGIMENS (if pembrolizumab contraindicated):
- Carboplatin AUC 6 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m² Q3 weeks
- Dose-dense AC → Paclitaxel (if considering neoadjuvant approach)

Patient prefers to start with pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel chosen 
over paclitaxel to avoid premedication and reduce neuropathy risk).

PLAN:

1. **START THERAPY: Cycle 1, Day 1 scheduled for February 3, 2025**
   - Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV over 30 minutes
   - Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m² (168 mg based on BSA 1.68 m²) IV over 30 minutes
   - Weekly nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, 15 of 28-day cycle
   - Pembrolizumab Q3 weeks (cycles 1, 2, 3, etc.)

2. **PREMEDICATIONS:**
   - Dexamethasone 10 mg IV prior to nab-paclitaxel (reduce hypersensitivity)
   - Ondansetron 16 mg IV for nausea prophylaxis
   - Famotidine 20 mg IV for gastric protection

3. **SUPPORTIVE CARE:**
   - Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg PO PRN anxiety with chemotherapy
   - Compazine 10 mg PO Q6H PRN breakthrough nausea
   - Gabapentin 300 mg daily for neuropathy prophylaxis (start after cycle 2)
   - Consider growth factor support (pegfilgrastim) if ANC <1000

4. **MONITORING:**
   - CBC with differential before each treatment (weekly initially)
   - CMP every 3 weeks
   - Thyroid function tests every 12 weeks (pembrolizumab can cause thyroiditis)
   - Restaging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 3 (week 12)
   - Monitor for immune-related adverse events (rash, diarrhea, hepatitis, pneumonitis)

5. **GENETIC TESTING:**
   - Await germline BRCA1/2 results
   - If BRCA+ and achieve response, consider PARP inhibitor maintenance (olaparib or talazoparib)

6. **EDUCATION:**
   - Discussed expected side effects: fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, neuropathy, 
     immune-related toxicities (rash, colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, thyroiditis)
   - Instructed to report fever >100.4°F, severe diarrhea, new rash, shortness of breath
   - Wig/head covering options discussed (alopecia expected with taxane)
   - Fertility not a concern (patient age 56, postmenopausal)

7. **PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT:**
   - Referral to social work for financial counseling (pembrolizumab expensive)
   - Support group information provided
   - Palliative care referral offered (patient declined for now, may reconsider later)

8. **FOLLOW-UP:**
   - Return for Cycle 1 Day 1 on February 3, 2025
   - Labs day before treatment
   - Will see every 3 weeks during active treatment
   - Urgent visit if fever, SOB, severe symptoms

PROGNOSIS:

Metastatic TNBC historically has median OS 12-18 months with chemotherapy alone. 
However, KEYNOTE-355 showed significantly improved outcomes with pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy in PD-L1+ patients (CPS ≥10):
- Median PFS: 9.7 months vs 5.6 months (chemo alone)
- Median OS: 23.0 months vs 16.1 months (chemo alone)

With modern treatment including immunotherapy, patient has reasonable chance of 
prolonged disease control. If BRCA mutation identified and responds to first-line 
therapy, PARP inhibitor maintenance could further extend PFS.

Patient understands diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan. All questions answered. 
She is motivated to proceed with pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel starting next week.

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:
================================================================================

56-year-old woman with newly diagnosed Stage IV triple-negative breast cancer with 
lung metastases, PD-L1 positive (CPS 15), ECOG 1, treatment-naïve.

PLAN: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3 weeks + Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m² IV weekly 
(3 weeks on, 1 week off) starting February 3, 2025.

Awaiting BRCA testing. If positive, will consider PARP inhibitor maintenance after 
response to chemotherapy.

Patient educated on treatment plan, expected side effects, and monitoring schedule. 
All questions addressed. She is in agreement with plan and ready to start therapy.
